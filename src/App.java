/**
 * Write code so:
 * 1. On start, a Rectangle is created that is centered in the middle of the 
 * Window with a width of 100 and a height of 70. To clarify, 
 * “centered” means that the center of the Rectangle will initially 
 * be in the exact center of the Window (x: 400, y: 300)
 * 
 * 2. When the mouse is clicked, the Rectangle should move up 5 pixels.
 * 
 * For extra achievement (eligible for A+):
 * Keep the previous parts intact, but also demonstrate higher levels of 
 * understanding in a way of your choosing.
